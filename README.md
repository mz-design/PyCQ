# About:
‚ÄúPyCQ‚Äù is simple Windows voice chat application allow central (Admin) PC (so called ‚ÄòCaller‚Äô application) connecting remote stations on Local Area Network (LAN) and send short voice messages / alerts in unicast, multicast or broadcast mode. PyCQ ‚ÄòStation‚Äô application should be installed on remote computers in order maintaining communication with ‚ÄòCaller‚Äô PC and play received messages / alerts.

# Requirements:
HW: Any 64-bit PC with 4Gb RAM is sufficient for running PyCQ in normal manner (8Gb recommended), 70MB of free HD space for installation, minimal display resolution >= 640x480 pixels, sound card.
SW: Microsoft Windows 10 and higher editions required to run this SW (Win-7 is incompatible with this build, in order to install on Win-7 PC code must be reworked for using recent python version =<3.8 and PySide5 / PyQt5 libraries).

# What‚Äôs in this build?
Specific functionalities were developed and implemented in this version:
Communication: UDP sockets for sending/listening to ‚Äúcaller advertise‚Äù packets, simple TCP application stack for maintaining signaling functionalities (including registration, connection restore and keep-alive procedures), simple HTTP Server serving voice messages to remote clients
Audio: applications automatically find and select preferred input/output audio HW based on specific PC configuration. Implemented setting audio stream volume, muting/unmuting non-application active audio streams during playback, audio recording and playback in various formats.
Application logic: Selection of single/multiple remote station for broadcast, message/alert types, message concurrency, message history and stations db.
GUI: introduced 2 applications ‚Äì ‚ÄòCaller‚Äô (windows main-form app.) and ‚ÄòStation‚Äô (resident tray icon app.) ‚ÄòStation‚Äô application initiates graphical popup followed by audio message/alarm prompt. Station popups are independent non-modal widgets running in separate processes that support multi-instancing and allows user to replay received messages and/or close each popup independently as well as sound playback implemented with threading and allows playing several concurrent streams in parallel. ‚ÄòCaller‚Äô application window allows operator observe available connected stations list, select specific station/multiple stations for sending voice messages, sending predefined ‚Äúsystem alerts‚Äù e.g. ‚ÄúFire Alert‚Äù, ‚ÄúIntruder Alert‚Äù, ‚ÄúMissile Attack‚Äù, ‚ÄúEarthquake and Tsunami Alerts‚Äù in broadcast mode to all available stations with single button click. It also provides convenient recoding and sending voice message with single button push.
Infrastructure: Logging support ‚Äì since PyCQ apps planned as standalone UI apps with no console the need of system log for debug was obvious. Custom logger class was developed using standard python logger libraries and running with both applications runtime, all debug print()s were disabled after finishing debugging the app in PyCharm IDE. Logging level can be adjusted by simply changing parameter in ‚Äúconstants‚Äù file as well as simple ‚Äúlog rotator‚Äù and clen-up procedures were implemented avoiding log and Message Store oversizing. System constants ‚Äì most application parameters can be configured in ‚Äòconstants.py‚Äô allowing better and faster rework and future implementations (see below):

# Added value features:
Convenient user interface allows dragging station message popups across the screen / multiple screens. It also allows the station user to configure the audio volume and popups transparency as well as exit the application directly from its tray icon menu. In some cases, administrators will want restricting users from changing message volume, tricking popup transparency or exiting station app ‚Äì in this case there are specific (true/false) parameters introduced in ‚Äòconstants.py‚Äô that can be easily changed and entire application recompiled in a moment and selected options will be disabled in UI.
Caller application tabs can be placed in any order convenient to caller user. Caller application also allows replaying last X messages stored in history (the max number of messages before clen-up also can be configured in ‚Äòconstants.py‚Äô.

# Testing:
All application modules were unit-tested prior delivery. Performed system test with 5 PCs (caller + 4 stations) ‚Äì personal environment limitation (I have only 5 inhouse‚Ä¶)  üòä
Tested with Win-10 and Win-11 as well both ‚Äòhome‚Äô and ‚ÄòPro‚Äô editions

# Known Issues:
No specific issues were observed during short testing period

# Q&A:
1.	**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs damn slow to startup‚Ä¶‚Äù** ‚Äì come on guys... it‚Äôs python, do you actually await performance of native C++ code??? And 67MB exe file includes ~800MB of compressed libraries inside üòä
2.	**Station tray icon not shown??** ‚Äì Windows 10 and 11 like ‚Äúhiding‚Äù unused tray icons. You can unhide it in ‚Äúwindows taskbar settings‚Äù.
3.	**It takes time Caller ‚Äúsee‚Äù available stations.** Basically, it can take up to ~30 sec after initial start of both applications. Caller Advertise UDP packets sent once per 5 sec, and ‚Äòperiodic registration‚Äô and ‚Äòperiodic keep-alive‚Äô parameters to 30 sec both by default (otherwise it will cause visible NW performance degradation in case of multiple stations and a lot of signaling)
4.	**Both PC are on same NW but not connected? Why?** ‚Äì Check if your PCs have single NW connection. When you have multiple NW adapters enabled in your PC it can cause routing problem on specific subnet. Disable second NW adapter or set ‚Äòmetric=1‚Äô on IP connected to LAN.
5.	**Sometimes I see Station disconnects from Caller and does not appear in stations‚Äô list?** - Specific can happen. Especially when connected with Wi-Fi router. WLAN able producing bursty traffic. This can happen basically on any Wi-Fi network of any kind, that can cause packet lost. In most situation connection will resume in single seconds, but you can try workaround it by increasing MAX_RETRANS parameter on specific NW adapter level or decreasing Wi-Fi Access Point retransmission interval. Cable Gigabit Ethernet NW are not affected by this (at least within my tests)
6.	**Application crashed!** ‚Äì strange‚Ä¶ for me it worked pretty stable üòä   - please open issue on GitHub. And if you will attach PyCQ.log file it will be even more than useful! Please provide as more information as you have ‚Äì this will mainly help in reproducing and fixing it.
7.	**How do I configure pop-up transparency and sound volume on Station app?**  - Right click application tray icon to open its context menu.
8.	**Where is the message in ‚ÄòMsgStore/‚Äô of  station after I closed the popup?**  - You can replay the message as much as you wish whilst the popup exists. Closing popup will inform the Caller the message was ‚Äúread‚Äù and it will remain in his message history, but station will delete it ‚Äì it‚Äôs ‚Äúby design‚Äù.
9.	**When I re-start standalone ‚Äò.exe‚Äô file there are no messages in message history and MsgStore folder is empty?** ‚Äì Yes, this is the way the ‚Äòfrozen‚Äô code works. Executable creates all data including /MsgStore/ and /resources/ folders as well as .csv files in Temporary folder when it started for this reason it can‚Äôt save the files from previous session. When you running native code in python project (i.e., PyCharm) you will continue working with same files and folder after restart.
10.	**How do I install it?** - Use setup files it will install everything automatically, or just place ‚Äò.exe‚Äô file in folder you want to run it from. Important! ‚Äì on first application run don‚Äôt forget to check both ‚Äòv‚Äô in Windows Defender Firewall popup that will appear. If you want starting Station app on system start, just copy shortcut to ‚Äòstation.exe‚Äô to windows startup folder.
